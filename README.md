# Watson NLP Application for Users' Emotions for a Product

# At a Glance

Natural language processing (NLP) is an exciting machine learning application; IBM's Watson NLP library can greatly ease the development and deployment of NLP as part of your application. Amazon's 5-star rating system lacks feedback for both users and buyers. What about using NLP for helpful information? In this project, we will develop an application to classify Amazon users' emotions using Watson NLP. After conducting this project, developers will know how to build a web scraping, emotion classification embedded application.

# Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in today's AI landscape. One such library designed for NLP tasks is Watson NLP, which offers a wide range of functions including document understanding, translation, and trust assessment. This library simplifies the development and deployment process of NLP models. You can use the Watson NLP library to enhance your application with sophisticated NL functionality to deliver better value to the users of your application.

In the Amazon marketplace, it's common for products to receive 4-5 star ratings. However, this system is limited and fails to provide a full picture of the buyer's experience. To address this issue, NLP models can be applied to product reviews to gain deeper insights into customer feedback.

In this project, we will walk through the process of building an application that uses Watson NLP to classify reviews from Amazon product links. We will provide step-by-step instructions and code snippets to help you build this application. Let's get started!
